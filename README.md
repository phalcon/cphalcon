Phalcon Framework
=================

Phalcon is a web framework delivered as a C extension providing high performance and lower resource consumption.

Get Started
-----------

Phalcon is written in C with platform independence in mind. As a result, Phalcon is available on Microsoft Windows, GNU/Linux, and Mac OS X. You can either download a binary package for the system of your choice or build it from sources.

### Windows

To use Phalcon on Windows, you only need to [download a DLL library](http://phalconphp.com/en/download/windows), place it in your `/php/ext` folder and then append at the last line (or whatever line you wish) of your `php.ini`:

```bash
extension=php_phalcon.dll
```

Finally, just restart your webserver and voil√†!

**Hint:** To ensure that your Phalcon installation was successful, debug with `<?php phpinfo(); ?>` and search for a section mentioning the Phalcon extension.

### Linux/Unix/Mac

On a Unix based platform you can easily compile and install the extension from sources.

#### Requirements
We need some packages previously installed.

* PHP 5.x development resources
* GCC compiler

Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php5-dev php5-mysql gcc make
```

Suse:

```bash
yast2 -i php5-pear php5-devel libmysqlclient gcc make autoconf2.13
```

CentOS / Fedora

```bash
sudo yum install php-devel php-mysql gcc make
```

Compilation
-----------

Follow these instructions to generate a binary extension for your platform:

```bash
git clone git://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon.git
cd cphalcon/build
sudo ./install
```

Add the extension to your php.ini:

```bash
extension=phalcon.so
```

Finally, restart the webserver
