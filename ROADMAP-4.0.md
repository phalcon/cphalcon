# Phalcon 4.0 Roadmap 
| Feature  | Describtion  | Date  |
| :------------: | :------------: | :------------: |
| Logger  Interface (PSR-3)  | The main goal is to allow libraries to receive a Psr\Log\LoggerInterface object and write logs to it in a simple and universal way  | N/A  |
|Caching Interface (PSR-6) | Caching is a common way to improve the performance of any project, making caching libraries one of the most common features of many frameworks and libraries  | N/A  |
| HTTP message interfaces (PSR-7)  | HTTP messages are typically abstracted from the end-user consumer, but as developers, we typically need to know how they are structured and how to access or manipulate them in order to perform our tasks, whether that might be making a request to an HTTP API, or handling an incoming request.  | N/A  |
| Container interface (PSR-11)  | This document describes a common interface for dependency injection containers. The goal set by ContainerInterface is to standardize how frameworks and libraries make use of a container to obtain objects and parameters  | N/A  |
| Link definition interfaces (PSR-13)  | This specification aims to provide PHP developers with a simple, common way of representing a hypermedia link independently of the serialization format that is used. That in turn allows a system to serialize a response with hypermedia links into one or more wire formats independently of the process of deciding what those links should be.  | N/A  |
| HTTP Server Request Handlers (PSR-15)  | HTTP request handlers are a fundamental part of any web application. Server side code receives a request message, processes it, and produces a response message. HTTP middleware is a way to move common request and response processing away from the application layer.  | N/A  |
| Common Interface for Caching Libraries (PSR-16)  | PSR-6 solves this problem already, but in a rather formal and verbose way for what the most simple use cases need. This simpler approach aims to build a standardized streamlined interface for common cases. It is independent of PSR-6 but has been designed to make compatibility with PSR-6 as straightforward as possible.  | N/A  |
| Improve Micro Applications | N/A | N/A |
