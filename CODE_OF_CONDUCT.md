# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## TL;DR

Common sense rules. Treat people the same way you want to be treated. 

## Detail

This is an open source project. Everyone and anyone is welcome to contribute 
to it as much or as little as they want to.

Personal views of contributors have no effect on the project and should be 
kept in the personal realm not this project.

It is a requirement to treat other contributors as well as maintainers with 
respect, when communicating in the realm of this project. It is OK to agree to 
disagree.

## Conflict

If ever conflict arises, please bring it to the attention of the maintainers 
privately. You can always find us on our [Discord](https://phalcon.io/discord) 
server or you can send us an email at team@phalcon.io 

The core team maintains the final decision on any conflict that may arise.
