**    JJCODETYPE         is the data type used for storing terminal
**                       and nonterminal numbers.  "unsigned char" is
**                       used if there are fewer than 250 terminals
**                       and nonterminals.  "int" is used otherwise.
**    JJNOCODE           is a number of type JJCODETYPE which corresponds
**                       to no legal terminal or nonterminal number.  This
**                       number is used to fill in empty slots of the hash 
**                       table.
**    JJFALLBACK         If defined, this indicates that one or more tokens
**                       have fall-back values which should be used if the
**                       original value of the token will not parse.
**    JJACTIONTYPE       is the data type used for storing terminal
**                       and nonterminal numbers.  "unsigned char" is
**                       used if there are fewer than 250 rules and
**                       states combined.  "int" is used otherwise.
**    phannot_JTOKENTYPE     is the data type used for minor tokens given 
**                       directly to the parser from the tokenizer.
**    JJMINORTYPE        is the data type used for all minor tokens.
**                       This is typically a union of many types, one of
**                       which is phannot_JTOKENTYPE.  The entry in the union
**                       for base tokens is called "jj0".
**    JJSTACKDEPTH       is the maximum depth of the parser's stack.
**    phannot_ARG_SDECL     A static variable declaration for the %extra_argument
**    phannot_ARG_PDECL     A parameter declaration for the %extra_argument
**    phannot_ARG_STORE     Code to store %extra_argument into jjpParser
**    phannot_ARG_FETCH     Code to extract %extra_argument from jjpParser
**    JJNSTATE           the combined number of states.
**    JJNRULE            the number of rules in the grammar
**    JJERRORSYMBOL      is the code number of the error symbol.  If not
**                       defined, then do no error processing.

/* Next are that tables used to determine what action to take based on the
** current state and lookahead token.  These tables are used to implement
** functions that take a state number and lookahead value and return an
** action integer.  
**
** Suppose the action integer is N.  Then the action is determined as
** follows
**
**   0 <= N < JJNSTATE                  Shift N.  That is, push the lookahead
**                                      token onto the stack and goto state N.
**
**   JJNSTATE <= N < JJNSTATE+JJNRULE   Reduce by rule N-JJNSTATE.
**
**   N == JJNSTATE+JJNRULE              A syntax error has occurred.
**
**   N == JJNSTATE+JJNRULE+1            The parser accepts its input.
**
**   N == JJNSTATE+JJNRULE+2            No such action.  Denotes unused
**                                      slots in the jj_action[] table.
**
** The action table is constructed as a single large table named jj_action[].
** Given state S and lookahead X, the action is computed as
**
**      jj_action[ jj_shift_ofst[S] + X ]
**
** If the index value jj_shift_ofst[S]+X is out of range or if the value
** jj_lookahead[jj_shift_ofst[S]+X] is not equal to X or if jj_shift_ofst[S]
** is equal to JJ_SHIFT_USE_DFLT, it means that the action is not in the table
** and that jj_default[S] should be used instead.  
**
** The formula above is for computing the action when the lookahead is
** a terminal symbol.  If the lookahead is a non-terminal (as occurs after
** a reduce action) then the jj_reduce_ofst[] array is used in place of
** the jj_shift_ofst[] array and JJ_REDUCE_USE_DFLT is used in place of
** JJ_SHIFT_USE_DFLT.
**
** The following are the tables generated in this section:
**
**  jj_action[]        A single table containing all actions.
**  jj_lookahead[]     A table containing the lookahead for each entry in
**                     jj_action.  Used to detect hash collisions.
**  jj_shift_ofst[]    For each state, the offset into jj_action for
**                     shifting terminals.
**  jj_reduce_ofst[]   For each state, the offset into jj_action for
**                     shifting non-terminals after a reduce.
**  jj_default[]       Default action for each state.

**    YYCODETYPE         is the data type used for storing terminal
**                       and nonterminal numbers.  "unsigned char" is
**                       used if there are fewer than 250 terminals
**                       and nonterminals.  "int" is used otherwise.
**    YYNOCODE           is a number of type YYCODETYPE which corresponds
**                       to no legal terminal or nonterminal number.  This
**                       number is used to fill in empty slots of the hash 
**                       table.
**    YYFALLBACK         If defined, this indicates that one or more tokens
**                       have fall-back values which should be used if the
**                       original value of the token will not parse.
**    YYACTIONTYPE       is the data type used for storing terminal
**                       and nonterminal numbers.  "unsigned char" is
**                       used if there are fewer than 250 rules and
**                       states combined.  "int" is used otherwise.
**    phql_TOKENTYPE     is the data type used for minor tokens given 
**                       directly to the parser from the tokenizer.
**    YYMINORTYPE        is the data type used for all minor tokens.
**                       This is typically a union of many types, one of
**                       which is phql_TOKENTYPE.  The entry in the union
**                       for base tokens is called "yy0".
**    YYSTACKDEPTH       is the maximum depth of the parser's stack.
**    phql_ARG_SDECL     A static variable declaration for the %extra_argument
**    phql_ARG_PDECL     A parameter declaration for the %extra_argument
**    phql_ARG_STORE     Code to store %extra_argument into yypParser
**    phql_ARG_FETCH     Code to extract %extra_argument from yypParser
**    YYNSTATE           the combined number of states.
**    YYNRULE            the number of rules in the grammar
**    YYERRORSYMBOL      is the code number of the error symbol.  If not
**                       defined, then do no error processing.

/* Next are that tables used to determine what action to take based on the
** current state and lookahead token.  These tables are used to implement
** functions that take a state number and lookahead value and return an
** action integer.  
**
** Suppose the action integer is N.  Then the action is determined as
** follows
**
**   0 <= N < YYNSTATE                  Shift N.  That is, push the lookahead
**                                      token onto the stack and goto state N.
**
**   YYNSTATE <= N < YYNSTATE+YYNRULE   Reduce by rule N-YYNSTATE.
**
**   N == YYNSTATE+YYNRULE              A syntax error has occurred.
**
**   N == YYNSTATE+YYNRULE+1            The parser accepts its input.
**
**   N == YYNSTATE+YYNRULE+2            No such action.  Denotes unused
**                                      slots in the yy_action[] table.
**
** The action table is constructed as a single large table named yy_action[].
** Given state S and lookahead X, the action is computed as
**
**      yy_action[ yy_shift_ofst[S] + X ]
**
** If the index value yy_shift_ofst[S]+X is out of range or if the value
** yy_lookahead[yy_shift_ofst[S]+X] is not equal to X or if yy_shift_ofst[S]
** is equal to YY_SHIFT_USE_DFLT, it means that the action is not in the table
** and that yy_default[S] should be used instead.  
**
** The formula above is for computing the action when the lookahead is
** a terminal symbol.  If the lookahead is a non-terminal (as occurs after
** a reduce action) then the yy_reduce_ofst[] array is used in place of
** the yy_shift_ofst[] array and YY_REDUCE_USE_DFLT is used in place of
** YY_SHIFT_USE_DFLT.
**
** The following are the tables generated in this section:
**
**  yy_action[]        A single table containing all actions.
**  yy_lookahead[]     A table containing the lookahead for each entry in
**                     yy_action.  Used to detect hash collisions.
**  yy_shift_ofst[]    For each state, the offset into yy_action for
**                     shifting terminals.
**  yy_reduce_ofst[]   For each state, the offset into yy_action for
**                     shifting non-terminals after a reduce.
**  yy_default[]       Default action for each state.

**    KKCODETYPE         is the data type used for storing terminal
**                       and nonterminal numbers.  "unsigned char" is
**                       used if there are fewer than 250 terminals
**                       and nonterminals.  "int" is used otherwise.
**    KKNOCODE           is a number of type KKCODETYPE which corresponds
**                       to no legal terminal or nonterminal number.  This
**                       number is used to fill in empty slots of the hash 
**                       table.
**    KKFALLBACK         If defined, this indicates that one or more tokens
**                       have fall-back values which should be used if the
**                       original value of the token will not parse.
**    KKACTIONTYPE       is the data type used for storing terminal
**                       and nonterminal numbers.  "unsigned char" is
**                       used if there are fewer than 250 rules and
**                       states combined.  "int" is used otherwise.
**    phvolt_KTOKENTYPE     is the data type used for minor tokens given 
**                       directly to the parser from the tokenizer.
**    KKMINORTYPE        is the data type used for all minor tokens.
**                       This is typically a union of many types, one of
**                       which is phvolt_KTOKENTYPE.  The entry in the union
**                       for base tokens is called "kk0".
**    KKSTACKDEPTH       is the maximum depth of the parser's stack.
**    phvolt_ARG_SDECL     A static variable declaration for the %extra_argument
**    phvolt_ARG_PDECL     A parameter declaration for the %extra_argument
**    phvolt_ARG_STORE     Code to store %extra_argument into kkpParser
**    phvolt_ARG_FETCH     Code to extract %extra_argument from kkpParser
**    KKNSTATE           the combined number of states.
**    KKNRULE            the number of rules in the grammar
**    KKERRORSYMBOL      is the code number of the error symbol.  If not
**                       defined, then do no error processing.

**                                      token onto the stack and goto state N.
**
**   KKNSTATE <= N < KKNSTATE+KKNRULE   Reduce by rule N-KKNSTATE.
**
**   N == KKNSTATE+KKNRULE              A syntax error has occurred.
**
**   N == KKNSTATE+KKNRULE+1            The parser accepts its input.
**
**   N == KKNSTATE+KKNRULE+2            No such action.  Denotes unused
**                                      slots in the kk_action[] table.
**
** The action table is constructed as a single large table named kk_action[].
** Given state S and lookahead X, the action is computed as
**
**      kk_action[ kk_shift_ofst[S] + X ]
**
** If the index value kk_shift_ofst[S]+X is out of range or if the value
** kk_lookahead[kk_shift_ofst[S]+X] is not equal to X or if kk_shift_ofst[S]
** is equal to KK_SHIFT_USE_DFLT, it means that the action is not in the table
** and that kk_default[S] should be used instead.  
**
** The formula above is for computing the action when the lookahead is
** a terminal symbol.  If the lookahead is a non-terminal (as occurs after
** a reduce action) then the kk_reduce_ofst[] array is used in place of
** the kk_shift_ofst[] array and KK_REDUCE_USE_DFLT is used in place of
** KK_SHIFT_USE_DFLT.
**
** The following are the tables generated in this section:
**
**  kk_action[]        A single table containing all actions.
**  kk_lookahead[]     A table containing the lookahead for each entry in
**                     kk_action.  Used to detect hash collisions.
**  kk_shift_ofst[]    For each state, the offset into kk_action for
**                     shifting terminals.
**  kk_reduce_ofst[]   For each state, the offset into kk_action for
**                     shifting non-terminals after a reduce.
**  kk_default[]       Default action for each state.
